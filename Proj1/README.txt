Run a build : If you want to run exe file, you can go "build" folder, 
and Run the "MAT300_jaewoo.choi_project1.exe" file.
when you click "increase degree" button degree would be up.
when you click "decrease" button the degree would be down.
On left of the screen there are two buttons.
When you click the "BB" button that curve would be calculated with BB-form,
 which is the sum of Bernstein polynomials.
When you click the "NLI" button that curve would be calculated with NLI-form,
