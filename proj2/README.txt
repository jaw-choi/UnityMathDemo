Make a project 2 with Unity platform
 
Rebuild:
I use Unity Engine.
So, if you want to run as a project with a code, Open the Unity hub, and press "Add" button, and then select MAT300_project2_jaewoo.choi folder.
Then, the project will be opened.
And, in the "Project" tab, Go to "Scenes" folder and double click "Template".
After then, you can play it in the editor.
+ if you want see all of codes, Go to Project tab -> Assets -> ReuseableScript.


Run a build : If you want to run exe file, you can go "build" folder, 
and Run the "Jaewoo.choi_MAT350_Project2_.exe" file.

I made three function 1. NLI, 2.BB,3.Mid Point function.
If you click right button, you can add a point
With left mouse drag, you can carry the position of the point
with reset button, the whole point would be reset.

When you open solution file you can see a bunch of the code that.
